#+DESCRIPTION: Superfly's personal NixOS configuration

* Extra repositories
** Syncthing
#+begin_src sh
wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/syncthing-archive-keyring.gpg https://syncthing.net/release-key.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/syncthing-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.syncthing.net/ syncthing stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/syncthing.list
#+end_src

* Update package repository
#+begin_src 
apt update
apt upgrade
#+end_src

* Extra packages
** Emacs
#+begin_src 
apt install emacs
#+end_src

** Syncthing
#+begin_src 
apt install syncthing
#+end_src

** Flatpak
I only install plasma-discover-backend-flatpak instead of the flatpak package as flatpak is already pinned as a dependency here. I use flatpaks for certain proprietary applications, namely Discord, Microsoft Teams and Zoom as well as to get more updated versions of certain applications I use, namely MuseScore.
#+begin_src 
apt install plasma-discover-backend-flatpak
#+end_src

** Nix
I like experimenting with Nix for container deployment, though I do not feel it is quite stable enough yet to do full deployments with.
#+begin_src 
apt install nix
#+end_src

* TODO
Add support for enabling user services
